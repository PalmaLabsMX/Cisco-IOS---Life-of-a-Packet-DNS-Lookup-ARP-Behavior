# Cisco IOS - Life of a Packet: DNS Lookup and ARP Behavior
In this lab, I have built and configured from scratch a simple network in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate how the Domain Name System and Address Resolution Protocol work together across different subnets.

## Network Topology
<img width="1560" height="563" alt="imagen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52bc1270-cf45-417e-8b81-1476ce94dd93" />

The topology above shows an interconnected network divided into three LAN subnets plus a point-to-point (P2P) link connecting the two routers.

## Objective

My goal is to illustrate the complete **life of a packet** when **Host A** initiates communication with the web server's FQDN (webserver.com). This project details:
- How DNS resolution maps hostnames to IP addresses
- How ARP resolves Next-Hop MAC addresses dynamically
- How Layer 2 framing changes at every hop while Layer 3 IP headers remain intact end-to-end

### DNS Server

### Web Server

TCP Ports 80 and 443 for web traffic are listening on the server

## DNS & ARP requests 

- **Host A** which has the IP 10.10.10.10 belongs to the pink 10.10.10.0/24 subnet, and wants to send a packet to the FQDN `webserver.com` at 10.10.12.10, but initially it doesn't know the destination IP address, so it will hold the original packet and send a DNS request to its DNS server at 10.10.100.10 (the DNS server is already configured at this point)
- **Host A** knows that its own IP address is on a different subnet of the DNS server's IP address, and that's why the DNS request needs to be sent via router R1
- **Host A** will hold the DNS request and first send a broadcast ARP request to the switch SW1 looking for its default gateway MAC address

<img width="703" height="276" alt="imagen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfac433c-4419-40ab-ac38-80dcd93da02f" /> 

- In this point, the broadcast ARP request is received by the switch SW1
- SW1 then will add an entry in its MAC address table maping Host A's MAC address 0007.EC96.2DE8 to port Fa0/1, so it knows that Host A is reachable through this port

- Finally SW1 will flood the broadcast traffic out all ports apart from the one it was received on (SW1 do this because FFFF.FFFF.FFF is the layer 2 broadcast address, it means "send the traffic everywhere")
